# Python 3 vs. 2: syntax/implementation differences e.g., print(), range().
# Also fixes and improvements e.g., integer division, increment, iterators.
# Many additions e.g., Unicode (UTF-8), generators, lazy structures, etc.
# Use Python 2 only if legacy code/libraries are needed. Otherwise, don't.

##  INTERACTIVE SHELL
##


#%% Allows all kinds of calculations ...
#   Instructions / code are executed immediately (no compilation!)
print('Welcome to Python!')

x = 10                              # variable created (virtual machine!)
x = x * x                           # then updated

                           # and printed

# or just "inspect" the variable (interpreter only)
x
#y                                  # error: variable not defined


# Using the shell as a calculator, interactively! no GUI, but natural syntax
print(25*7 - 13*4)

# Last expression/result available via _ character (can print too...)
# _ * 2


#%% The following is also a Python script / program!
price = 1200
vat = 0.15                          # note: no type! (but see later)
price += price * vat
print(price)                        # no semi-colon: EOL = end of statement
print(vat);                         # (legal but useless semi-colon)

price *= 1.2 ; print(price)         # semi-colon as separator (alt. to EOL)

# Allows all kinds of calculations e.g., to estimate someone's final grade,
# trying many scenarios, programmatically. Example with a range 'for' loop
# (cf. section 3 Flow Control and section 8 about Generators and Iterators).
gradeSoFar = 80
for finalExamGrade in range(40, 100, 5):
    print(finalExamGrade, '->', 0.70 * gradeSoFar + 0.30 * finalExamGrade)

# All the way to powerful computing e.g., series: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/10
sum(1/x for x in range(1,11))

# using Higher-Order Functions and Comprehensions (cf. later sections) [FP]
sum(x**3 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0)


#%% Python script / program = Python code in a text file e.g., test.py
# To run a script, either (1) open in IDLE and run it (via F5 'Run Module'),
# (2) run it directly in a terminal: python test.py, (3) select test.py and
# 'open with' python.exe (In the last two cases a shell window will open and
# then close quickly, unless user input is required or some GUI is started.)

# One can also open a script and interpret its content programmatically e.g.:
script = "print('hello')"
exec(script)
#exec(open('01-xTkConverterGUIdemo.py').read())

# Single expressions can be interpreted and evaluated instead e.g.:
eval('1 + 2')
# which means one can generate code on the fly and execute it! [FP]
eval('print(8 /' + str(x) + ')')


#%% Experimenting ... typing and evaluating at once e.g., factorial function
# (cf. Flow Control and Functions sections for full details and examples)

def fact(n):                        # function declaration
    if n == 1:                      # function body
        return 1                    # if/else block - indented for syntax!
    else:                           # (1 indent = 4 spaces, exactly)
        return n * fact(n-1)        # note: no parentheses, no brackets

fact(20)
#fact(1024)                         # a very large number, still fast enough
#len(str(fact(1024)))               # -> 2640 = number of digits! [FP]

#fact(1025)                         # RuntimeError: max recursion depth
                                    # exceeded (cf. section 6 Exceptions)

# note: The above limit is when using IDLE. In Anaconda + Snyder one can run
#len(str(fact(2958)))               # so fact(2958) has 8985 digits

# Same factorial function, using functional programming style [FP]
def ffact(n): return 1 if n==1 else n * fact(n-1)


#%% Importing from a module
import math
print(math.pi)                      # need specify scope

# importing selectively

from math import factorial as fac   # or with a custom name
fac(4321)                           # (squeezed output? click to see)

##  OBJECTS AND TYPES
##


#%% Dynamic typing! Variables defined as and when declared and initialized.
# Type inference! Variable type is automatically determined. So Python is
# neither strongly typed like C++/Java nor typeless like Lisp/Scheme...
x = 5
type(x)                             # 'x' is an object of integer class
x = 'hi!'
type(x)                             # now 'x' is a string object
x = True
type(x)                             # and now it's a Boolean

# Python is strongly typed in the sense that operations incompatible with the
# data type are not allowed (will raise an exception); but it is not static.
# e.g. 2+3 is fine, "two"+"three" is fine, but 2+"three" is not (TypeError!)


# Warning: Everything is a 'variable'! even functions, classes, modules...
# Be careful not to override names e.g., str = "hello" or type = 4


#%% References! (similar to Java) - x above is a reference, not an object
a = 1
type(a)                             # reference to 'int' object (value 1)
b = a                               # another reference to the same object
a = a + 1
a                                   # now refers to another 'int' object (2)
b                                   # refers to the same old 'int' object (1)

# Everything in Python is an object! [pure OOP] incl. functions, classes,
# modules, etc. (and almost everything has attributes and methods). Therefore
# every name / variable is merely a reference to an object! Note also that
# many are immutable [FP] e.g., bool, int, float, str... list, and many more!
print(b, fact, 'hi', str)


# One can 'undefine' a variable but it only deletes the name/reference; it
# does not free the memory. For that, Python has garbage collection!
del x
#print(x)                           # NameError: name 'x' is not defined

del a                               # not like C++ pointers!
print(b)                            # the (int) object is still in memory


#%% Interactive help, about functions, classes, etc. Call help() for prompt.
help
help(print)

# List all instance attributes, functions/methods, and attributes of a class
dir(str)
'find' in dir(str)                  # is 'find' defined for the str class?
dir('a string')
dir()                               # shows all symbols defined in scope

'/'.join(['dir','subdir','file'])   # joining strings, with separator
'dir/subdir/file'.split('/')        # splitting, based on separator

# note: String objects are immutable hence concatenating many strings together

# approach is to place all strings into a list and call join() at the end.


#%% Splitting and partitioning

'john henry doe'.split('h')

'john henry doe'.partition(' ')     # 2-way split, forward or backward
'john henry doe'.rpartition(' ')

# Simple code, thanks to string split, unpacking, and parallel assignment [FP]
address = 'monty@python.org'
username, domain = address.split('@')   # isn't that beautiful?

# Example of parsing an(y) URL to get the domain extension! (com,edu,org...)
url = 'http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html'
url.split('://')[-1].split('/')[0].split('.')[-1] # OO-style cascading [FP]

def split(s,y): return s.split(y)
split(split(split(url,'://')[-1],'/')[0],'.')[-1] # functional prog. style

str.split(url,'://')
print(split)
print(str.split)

len(str(0.1234567).split('.')[-1])  # number of decimals [FP]


# note: The str class is quite powerful as is. There is also a string module,
# which offers even more functionality. Then, there are regular expressions!

##  STRING FORMAT AND OLD %
##


#%% Old 'printf'/'scanf' style (only int, str, and double are supported):

from math import pi                 # pi in math module (48 decimals)
print(pi)                           # default prints only 15 decimals

print('The value of PI is approximately %.4f' % pi)   # 4 decimals

for n in range(1,60):
    print(('%'+str(n+6)+'.'+str(n)+'f') % pi) # varying number of decimals


# Be careful (again), this is Python:
pi = 'apple'                        # destroys original pi value!
from math import pi                 # (only way to restore it)


#%% String format, using {} as placeholder
'1 plus 2 equals {}'.format(3)
'1: {}, 2: {}, 3: {}'.format('A', 0xFFFF, 3+2j) # default order
'3: {2}, 2: {1}, 1: {0}'.format('a', 'b', 'c')  # custom order

# Using positional arguments as references!
'complex {0} has a real part {0.real}\
 and imaginary part {0.imag}'.format(3+2j)
'1: {0[0]}, 2: {0[1]}, 3: {0[2]}'.format(['a', 'b', 'c'])
'2-1: {0[1][0]}, 2-2: {0[1][1]}'.format(['a', ['b','c'],'d'])

# Using (more flexible) keyword arguments instead (cf. Function args)
'Coords: {lat}, {lon}'.format(lon='-115.8W', lat='37.2N')


#%% Like Java, Python supports Unicode (UTF-8 by default! not UTF-16)
print( 'Hello, \u0057\u006F\u0072\u006C\u0064!')    # interpreted code
print(r'Hello, \u0057\u006F\u0072\u006C\u0064!')    # raw string ('as is')

print('\u0645\u0631\u062d\u0628\u0627',       # "Hello, good morning"

# Left/right/center justification
'{:<30}'.format('left aligned')
'{:>30}'.format('right aligned')

##  STRING LITERALS [v3.6+]
##


#%% F-strings are more concise and readable than using string format

import datetime                     # (using the powerful datetime module)
name, bday, value = 'Fred', datetime.date(1991, 10, 12), 421
bday
print(bday)                         # custom print function (string repr.
                                    # is not the object - cf. Classes)

# For example, the formatting string and directive
'The value is {}.'.format(value)
# can be written more concisely using an f-string:
f'The value is {value}.'

# Previous example with two variables for data and format:
print(f'The volume is {volume:.{decimals}f} cm\u00b3')

# Provides additional formats not available with %-formatting or string format
f'input={value:#06x}'
f'{bday} was on a {bday:%A}'        # date and week day

age = datetime.date.today().year - bday.year
f"My name is {name}. I am {age}. I'm born on {bday:%A, %B %d, %Y}."


#%% Type conversion may be specified (similar to string format): '!s' calls
# str() on the expression, '!r' calls repr(), and '!a' calls ascii().
# Compare e.g.:
f'He said his name is {name}.'      # string representation
f'He said his name is {name!r}.'    # printable representation

# Backslashes may not appear inside a f-string; so the correct way to have a
# literal brace appear in the resulting string value is to double the brace:
f'{{ {4*10} }}'

# Yes, f-strings are evaluated! Another example:
f'result={factorial(5)}'

# The above is equivalent to:
'result={}'.format(factorial(5))
'result=' + str(factorial(5))

for n in range(2,16):
    print(f'{pi:{n+6}.{n}}') 	    # varying number of decimals (more concise)


#%% F-strings for debugging!

# Add the = symbol at the end of an expression to print both the expression
# and its value (with or without spaces):
from sys import version
version_number = version.split()[0]

print(f'Python {version_number}') # vs.
print(f'Python {version_number=}')

# Previous example again
print(f'The result is {volume=:.{decimals}f} cm\u00b3')

##  PYTHON CODING STYLE
##


#%% Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.
# Wrap lines so that they don't exceed 79 characters.
# Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and large blocks of code.
# When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
# Use doc strings.
# Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside
#     bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4); not f( 1, 2 )...
# Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use
#     CamelCase for classes and lower_case_with_underscores for functions
#     and methods. Use self as the name for the first method argument.
# Don't use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in
#     international environments. Python's default UTF-8 works best.
