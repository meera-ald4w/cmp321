"""
  Different programming languages define "object" in different ways. In some,
  it means that all objects must have attributes and methods; in others, it
  means that all objects are subclassable. In Python, the definition is looser;
  some objects have neither attributes nor methods, and not all objects are
  subclassable. But everything is an object in the sense that it can be
  assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function.

  This is so important that I'm going to repeat it in case you missed it the
  first few times: Everything in Python is an object. Strings are objects.
  Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Even modules are objects.

#   can use a namedtuple instead (often a better design).

##  NESTED CLASSES
##


#%% In Python anything can be nested within anything. Functions in the main
#   are regular functions while functions nested within a class are methods.
# Classes can be nested with classes or functions... basically they should
# be defined wherever appropriate, regardless of other considerations.

    outvar = 1
    class Inner:
        def printOuterVar():
            print(Outer.outvar)     # Outer class name needed (for scope!)

Outer.Inner.printOuterVar()         # shows the nested attribute

#  . . .    print(outvar)   would cause a NameError: 'outvar' not defined

# note: Unlike in Java, in Python (also C++ and C#) there is no implicit
# binding between the nested/inner class and the enclosing/outer class.
# -> required is: print(Outer.outvar)

print(Outer.outvar)                 # works, of course ("public" class var)


# Classic example of a linked list with a nested node class
class doubly_linked_list(object):
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data=None, prev=None, next=None):
            self.data, self.prev, self.next = data, prev, next

# p.__print()                       # (since the name has been mangled)

# Note: Python is designed to be simple, interpreted, and then scripts are
# distributed as source 99.1% of the time. So, if users have the source code,
# they can see everything and change anything they like! Hence there is no
# point declaring something "private", when users can make it "public"!
#
# Therefore Python has encapsulation/classes and polymorphism/inheritance but
# no data hiding. Also it allows function overriding, but not overloading.
# (Note that implementing access control - private vs. public vs. protected -
# implies a lot of complexity as well as performance overhead at runtime...)

repr('Python')                      # vs. "'Python'"

# The __str__ function (str) converts an object into a human-readable form
# i.e. what you, as a user, might wish to see when you print an object out.
# The __repr__ function (also repr) converts an object into a string which
# you, as a programmer, might wish to have to recreate the object e.g.
# using the eval() function.

#eval(str('Python'))                # NameError: 'Python' not defined

# -> 'datetime.datetime(2018, 3, 1, 15, 52, 15, 760365)'
print(eval(repr(now)))

# note: Python 2 had the backquote (like Lisp/Scheme!) as a shortcut for
# repr i.e. you could write print(" answer = `f()` ") where f() would be
# evaluated, so the output might be e.g. answer = 42
#
# In Python 3 you can do the same with: print(" answer = " + repr(f()))
# In v3.6 onward you can use formatted strings: print(f'answer = {f()}')
# so basically curly brackets have replaced the Lisp-like backquotes...

# note also that the print() function uses __str__, if defined, and __repr__
# otherwise. The interpreter uses __repr__ only.

# note: super is actually a class! Its constructor returns a proxy object
# that allows delegating method calls to a parent or sibling class of type.
# This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden
# in a class. (Now this is one of these really weird Python things... ;)
#
# Use Case 1: super can be called upon in a single inheritance, in order to
# refer to the parent class (or multiple classes) without explicitly naming
# them. It's like a shortcut. (This is the case illustrated above.)
# Importantly, it helps to keep your code maintainable (no explicit name).
#
# Use Case 2: Super can be called upon in a dynamic execution environment
# for multiple or collaborative inheritance. This use is considered exclusive
# to Python, because it is not possible with languages that only support
# single inheritance or are statically compiled (like C++/Java).

##  INTERFACES IN PYTHON
##


#%% Interfaces are all implicit in Python i.e., there is no explicit interface
# syntax (as in Java). For a Python class to implement an interface means to
# define one or more required functions - that's it!
#
# For any object to be 'printable' in Python i.e., so that print() will work
# with it, its class only needs to implement the __str__() function (and make
# it return a string object comprising the desired attributes). Almost every
# built-in Python class is printable.
#
# For any object to be 'comparable' its class must implement __eq__() so that
# x == y will work as expected (also __ne__() for difference, x != y).
#
# To make any object 'countable', its class needs to implement the __len__()
# function (and make it return an integer). Many Python classes are countable
# e.g., all containers / sequences (list, dict... str...)
#
# To be a container / sequence, a class must implement __contains__() so it
# will work with membership functions e.g., if x in X: ...
# Then, to support slicing, a sequence must implement __getitem__().
#
# For any object to be an 'iterable', its class must implement the __iter__()
# function (to return an iterator, which can be done simply using iter() for
# example). Python classes such as range, zip, and enumerate are iterables, so
# are all containers / sequences...
#
# Likewise an iterator is a class that implements a __next__() function...
# (Cf. section 8 Iterators and Generators).
#
# For a class to be 'hashable' i.e., so it will work with maps and hash tables
# et al, it must implement the __hash__() function. Almost every Python class
# is hashable (if it makes sense).
#
# To make any object 'callable', like a function, its class needs to implement
# the __call__() function (the body of which is executed when a call is made).
#
# To implement an interface in Python means to fully and properly implement
# the desired functions and behaviour: it is the programmer's responsibility
# to do so (Python will not check). If coded correctly, then it "just works".
#
# This design paradigm is known as Python "duck typing": if your code "looks
# like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck!". (In AI we also calls
# this de-duck-tive reasoning ;-)
#
# Note that, in addition to the above examples, Python uses interfaces for:
# Classifier, Clustering, Converter, Distribution, Evaluation, Regression,
# Serialization, and many more.
# (See also: Python design by Contract @ http://pythondbc.codeplex.com/)
