###   07. HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS AND COMPREHENSIONS
###



# As seen earlier, Python supports several Functional Programming features,
# including Higher-Order Functions: this means functions are objects like any
# other i.e., first-class entities, and can be stored in variables, modified
# dynamically, passed as function arguments, returned as the value of other
# function calls, etc. (cf. Functions and Lambda Expressions section)

# Why iteration? Why do we need 'for loops'? Recall that iteration as such
# only exists because of computer hardware. Mathematically, repetition is
# induction is recursion. It is also about problem solving: programmers work
# mostly by recognizing categories of problems that come up repeatedly and
# remembering the solution that worked last time; therefore, programmers
# should learn these program patterns (software design patterns) and apply
# them as appropriate for each specific problem.

# Here are the most common patterns for repetition, which high-level (a.k.a.
# higher-order) functions can help model and apply easily: Every (apply/map),
# Keep (filter), Accumulate (reduce), Combine (composition), side effects.

# It is a fact than most complex loops are actually a mixture of the above,
# and could be split into component patterns (example of code refactoring).
# In the end there are very few cases where coding a loop is actually needed.
# (cf. Introduction to Functional Programming slides for more...)

##
##  EVERY PATTERN - APPLY/MAP
##


#%% The EVERY Pattern - This is when we want to perform the same query to a
#   collection of objects. Typically we collect the results of transforming
# each item into something else. Functions: apply/map.


# Example of 'low-level' list processing
lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
rsl = []
for i in range(len(lst)):           # bad (imperative or "C style")
    rsl.append(lst[i]**2)

rsl = []
for n in lst:                       # much better (range loop)
    rsl.append(n**2)                # or: rsl += [n**2]


# Map: from list (or other iterable) to list: map(func,iter) -> list
#      one-to-one mapping: [x1, x2, ... xN] -> [f(x1), f(x2), ... f(xN)]
# Use map to repeatedly apply a transformation and collect the results.

# Example above:
map( lambda n: n**2, lst)           # best - applying a lambda expression!


#%% note: Python has a simple syntax but, not simple enough yet; e.g.
#   Python: map( lambda n: n**2, range(1,1001) )
# vs. Haskell: map ^2 [1..N]

list( map( lambda n: n**2, lst))    # note that map is actually a generator
                                    # (cf. Iterators and Generators section)
lss = ['1','2','3','4']
list( map( int, lss))               # applying a (named) function

list( map( lambda n: n**2, map( int, lss))) # composition - very simple
                                    # but requires multiple traversals

list( map( lambda n: int(n)**2, lss)) # same coded manually, one traversal


# note: Functional Programming is all about function COMPOSITION (see below)
# e.g. Python:  map( ... n**2, map( ... int, range(1,N+1) ))
#  vs. Haskell: map (^2 . int) [1..N]
# Because it is more efficient to compose first, then apply!


#%% Deck of cards example - high level programming
cards = ['1S','3C','08D','QH','7C','10H','JD','13S']

list( map( lambda s: s[-1], cards))

sorted( set( map( lambda s: s[-1], cards))) # 'set' for unicity! [FP]

# get the card values
list(map( lambda s: int(s[:-1]) if s[:-1].isnumeric() else 0, cards))
sum( map( lambda s: int(s[:-1]) if s[:-1].isnumeric() else 0, cards)) #(HHGG!)

list( map( lambda N: 0.70*80+0.30*N, range(40,100,5))) # ex. from Intro


#%% Applying a predicate function to every element, logical composition
list( map( lambda n: n%2 != 0, lst))

def odd(n): return n%2 != 0
list( map( odd, lst))

any( map( odd, lst))                # true if any is true (logical OR)
all( map( odd, lst))                # true if all are true (logical AND)


# Map can handle multiple arguments as well (more examples below)
v1,v2 = [1, 2, 3],[7, 5, 3]
list( map(lambda x,y: x*y, v1, v2))

##  KEEP PATTERN - FILTER
##


# The KEEP Pattern - This is when we want to choose some of the items in a
# collection of objects. We collect the results of this selection and forget
# about the other items. Functions: filter.


#%% Example of 'low-level' list processing ("C style" - don't do that)
rsl = []
for n in lst:
    if odd(n): rsl.append(n)

# Filter: from list (or other iterable) to sublist: filter(func,iter) -> list
# Use filter to repeatedly apply a predicate and select items accordingly.
# Examples above:
list( filter(odd, lst))

list( filter( lambda x: x%2 != 0, lst)) # note that filter is also a generator

list( filter( lambda s: not s[0].isdigit(), cards))

list( filter( lambda s: s.startswith(('K','Q','J')), cards))


# Record selection
customers = [('Jack', 'jack@apple.com', 11), ('Jill', 'jill@google.com', 3),
             ('Joe', 'joe@apple.com', 7)]
list( filter( lambda x: 5 < x[-1] < 10, customers))
list( filter( lambda x: x[1].split('@')[1].split('.')[0].lower() == 'apple',
              customers))

#%% More examples

# Text filtering (see also Section 9 Regular Expressions)
txt = 'He was carefully disguised yet he was quickly found (polyonymy).'
list( filter( lambda w: w.endswith('ly'), txt.split()))

# Just for fun (what does this do?)
list(filter( lambda x: x**3 - 15*x**2 + 66*x - 80 == 0, range(1,20))) #10**6

# Checking for palindromes - a simple one-liner!
words = ['geeks', 'geeg', 'keek', 'practice', 'aa', 'Abba', 'racecar']
list(filter(lambda w: w == ''.join(reversed(w)), words))
list(filter(lambda w: w == w[::-1], words))

list(filter(lambda w : w not in words[1::2], words))

##  ACCUMULATE PATTERN - REDUCE
##


# The ACCUMULATE Pattern - This is when we want to combine some data by
# applying some process to a collection of objects. We collect the single
# result obtained from aggregating partial results (e.g. sum, count, etc.)
# Functions: reduce.


#%% functools module for higher-order functions
from functools import reduce        # (used to be in main module)

# Reduce: from list (or other iterable) to value: reduce(func,iter) --> value
# Use reduce to repeatedly apply a function and aggregate the results.
# Example of a sum:
reduce(lambda x,y: x + y, lst)      # evaluated recursively, left to right
                                    # i.e. as follows: ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5)+...

sum(lst)                            # same, using built-in sum function
sum(x for x in lst)                 # comprehension style (see below)
sum(x for x in lst[::2])            # same as sum(lst[::2]) in this case

reduce(lambda x,y: x * y, lst)      # product!

from math import prod               # since [v3.8]
prod(lst)                           # same, using built-in prod function

# Careful, 'product' is a different function i.e., Cartesian product
from itertools import product
list( product([1,2,3],['a','b']))


# Example of finding the minimum:
lsr = [10,7,21,5,33,14,50]
reduce(lambda x,y: x if x < y else y, lsr) # 10,7 -> 7; then 7,21 -> 7;
                                           # 7,5 -> 5; 5,33 -> 5; etc.

reduce(min, lsr)                    # same, using built-in min function
min(lsr)                            # (which is recursive, of course)


#%% Functional Programming languages include a generic FOLD function or even
# a family of higher-order functions realizing high level software patterns.
# Folding allows to deconstruct or reduce data. A typical signature for fold
# is  fold f a s  where
# f is a higher-order function taking two arguments, an accumulator and an
# element of the sequence s. It is applied recursively to each element of s.
# a is the initial value of the accumulator and an argument of the function f.
# s is a sequence of elements.
#
# Fold functions come in different kinds, the two main linear ones are foldl
# and foldr, that are left- and right- associative, respectively. [This also
# related to grammars and parsing, cf. chapters 3 and 4.]
#
# Example:  foldl * 10 [3,4,5] evaluates to (((10*3)*4)*5)
# Likewise: foldr * 10 [3,4,5] evaluates to (3*(4*(5*10)))
# Clearly for commutative operators e.g., addition and multiplication, both
# are equivalent. Not so otherwise e.g., subtraction and division.
# Example: foldl / 10 [3,4,5] is (((10/3)/4)/5) = 0.1666
# However: foldr / 10 [3,4,5] is (3/(4/(5/10))) = 0.375
#
# So, reduce in Python is basically foldl (left-associative, as seen above).

import operator                     # for add, sub, mul... (cannot use + * -)
# foldl in Python
foldl = lambda fun, acc, xs: reduce(fun, xs, acc)

foldl(operator.mul, 10, [3,4,5])
foldl(operator.truediv, 10, [3,4,5]) # (truediv is / and floordiv is //)

# foldr can be implemented in Python using the duality theorem, which states
# that a right-associative operation applied to a sequence of elements is the
# same as the left-associative equivalent applied to the reverse sequence.
foldr = lambda fun, acc, xs: reduce(lambda x,y: fun(y,x), reversed(xs), acc)

foldr(operator.mul, 10, [3,4,5])
foldr(operator.truediv, 10, [3,4,5])


# note: C++14 has accumulate, Maple/Mathematica/Matlab have fold (foldl/foldr),
#       Java 8, JavaScript 1.8, R, Swift 3 have reduce (foldl) ...
#       Haskell and List/Scheme have foldl and foldr.

# note: map/filter are high-level replacements for loops that apply a process/
# predicate to a collection of items, respectively. reduce (foldl) is a high-
# level replacement for loops that accumulate a result, hence also for
# accumulator-recursive functions!

##  COMBINE PATTERN

# combination of several simpler functions, then apply it to the data.
# (Python does not support implicit composition hence optimization.)

# algorithm of fame: map a search query to multiple servers then aggregate
# and present the results to the client i.e., kind of:
# reduce( combine_results, map( search_query, all_servers))

# Cards example again, using string + operator (i.e., add/concat)
