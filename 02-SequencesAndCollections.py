##  LISTS
##


#%% The list class is a mutable, sequential data structure, implemented as a
#   variable-length array of references to objects, using exponential over-
#   allocation for performance.
#
# It is the one data structure to use instead of static/dynamic arrays or
# singly/doubly connected node structures or vector/list objects (C++/Java).
# Note also that it provides better readability and writability...

l = ['one', 'two', 'three']
type(l)                             # 'list' object
isinstance(l, list)                 # checking the type (hierarchical)
isinstance(l, (list,tuple))         # OR: true if a list or a tuple

l.append('four')                    # appending one item at the end
l.insert(2,'more')                  # inserting at position (given index)

l = l + ['five', 'six']             # list concatenation
['zero'] + l
l.extend([7,8,9])                   # appending multiple items
l * 2                               # repetition! -> new list object

ll = l[:]                           # list copy
l2 = l.copy()                       # many classes implement copy / deepcopy
l3 = list(l)                        # same (like copy constructor)

# Careful again, there is no checking: list = [1,2,3] destroys the class!
# It works because a "class name" is just a reference to an object (instance
# of the 'class' class!) and references can be changed (reassigned).


#%% Generic containers and sequences (only contains references anyway!)

#%% The tuple class is like a lightweight, immutable list. It offers fewer
#   methods but much better performance. For instance, the memory used for
#   tuples is managed very cleverly to minimize de/allocation...
#
# Note that tuples are used a lot *inside* Python to implement many language
# features, such as parallel assignment, returning multiple values from a
# function (see examples hereafter), etc.

t = (1,2,3)                         # a 'tuple' object
type(t)

#t[1] = "one"                       # TypeError: no item assignment

u = 2, 4, 6                         # packing (parentheses are optional)
print(u)
t + u[1:2]                          # new tuple, via slicing + concatenation

x,y,z = t                           # unpacking (num of values must match)

for item in t: print(item)          # tuples are also iterables

a, b = 1, 2                         # parallel assignment again: implemented
a, b = (1,2)                        # via a tuple!
tp = (1, 2)                         # same, items are first packed in a tuple
a, b = tp                           # which is then unpacked

def sqpair(x): return x, x**2       # functions can return multiple values!
v,v2 = sqpair(7)                    # (w/ good readability and writability)

def sqPair(x): return tuple(x, x**2)# same, but tuple is created explicitly

u = 2,                              # singleton (comma needed, else 'int')
u = ('two',)                        # singleton (comma, else 'string')


#%% More examples e.g. conversion
lt = list(t)                        # list constructor (with tuple arg)
lt[1] = -2 ; lt.append(4)
tt = tuple(lt)                      # tuple constructor (with list arg)

pA , pB = (2,7) , (5,-1)            # two 2D points (immutable!)
pA[0] * pB[0] + pA[1] * pB[1]       # dot product

# More elegant with NAMED TUPLES i.e., tuples with fields (immutable struct)
from collections import namedtuple
point = namedtuple('point', ['x', 'y']) # 2D point struct (opt: verbose=True)

pA, pB = point(2,7) , point(5,-1)   # same syntax as when using a point class
pA.x * pB.x + pA.y * pB.y           # now accessing fields/attributes by name!

px, py = pA                         # unpack like a regular tuple
px == pA.x

#pA.x = 5                           # AttributeError: can't set attribute


# A general design rule is that "tuples have structure, lists have order".
# So tuples are used as heterogeneous data structures containing unmodifiable
# data e.g., the name, ID, and birthdate of a person, the X,Y coordinates of
# a point in the plane, numbers, etc.
# While they can contain any data, lists are homogeneous more often than not
# e.g., one may define a list of student names or IDs, a shopping list (of
# products), a list of 2D points (for a polygon), etc.
# Yes, the list data structure in Python is generic (it can store anything)
# but that is really a consequence of having dynamic types...


# note: A tuple is immutable, which means we cannot add, remove, or change any
# of its content e.g., any of the four references in the example below.
# However, through those references, we can modify the objects being referred
# to, IFF they are mutable (like in Java) e.g., any of the lists below.
tt = ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9])
#tt[1] = [444,2,1]                  # TypeError: ... no item assignment
tt[1][0] = 444
tt[1][0:2] = ['tada', 'voila', 'done']

##  DICTIONARIES
##


#%% The dictionary class is a mutable associative array (a.k.a. map) that is
#   implemented as a hash table with open addressing, with sophisticated
#   hashing and rehashing functions (see below).

# A dictionary stores key-value pairs e.g.
d = { 'fr': 'France', 'uk': 'United Kingdom', 'it':'???' }
type(d)                             # 'dict' object
print(d)                            # actual order may depend on hashing

#d[1]                               # KeyError: only key indexing allowed
d['fr']                             # same as d.get('fr')
d.keys()
d.values()
d.items()

for k in d: print(k)                # dictionaries are iterables

for k in d.keys(): print(k)         # same, iterating over dictionary keys

for v in d.values(): print(v)       # iterating over dictionary values
for k in d: print(d[k])             # same, getting values from the keys


d['it'] = 'Italy'                   # replacing value for given key
d['ch'] = 'Switzerland'             # adding new key-value pair
del d['uk']                         # removing key-value pair

d[42] = 'yes'                       # adding key 42 (not an index)

a,b,c = {1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c'}       # unpacking a dictionary (keys)
print( [*d] )


#%% Example of a dictionary of 2D points (defined earlier)
points = { 'A': (2,5), 'B': (4,1), 'C': (-2,0), 'P': point(7,11) }

print(points.keys())                # iterator (cf. section 8 Iterators)
print(list(points.keys()))          # now a list is explicitly generated

points['B']
points['A'][0]
points['P'].x                       # nicer syntax using namedtuple

for k in points.keys(): print(points[k]) # point coords
for k in points: print(points[k])   # simpler
for v in points.values(): print(v)  # better


#%% Any *immutable* object can be used as a key e.g. int, string, tuple...
d[3.14] = 'pi'
d[(1,2,3)] = 'a tuple key!'
d['flag'] = ['red','green','blue']
print(d)
#d[[1]]=1                           #-> TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

# Hashing is built-in for all Python immutable classes
hash(1)
hash('1')                           # string hash - function or method
'1'.__hash__()                      # (cf. section 5 Classes and OOP)
hash((1,2))
#hash([1,2])


# Every immutable class in Python comes with a built-in __hash__() function.
#
# Example - Hash function for strings / the str class (pseudo-code):
# arguments: string object; returns: hash
# function string_hash:
#    if hash cached: return it
#    set len to string's length
#    initialize var p pointing to 1st char of string object
#    set x to value pointed by p left shifted by 7 bits
#    while len >= 0:
#        set var x to (1000003 * x) xor value pointed by p
#        increment pointer p
#    set x to x xor length of string object
#    cache x as the hash so we don't need to calculate it again
#    return x as the hash
#
# Rehashing is performed via efficient randomized quadratic probing.


#%% The dictionary data structure is not immutable, but is now ordered [v3.7].

dd = dict([ ('z', 26), ('g', 7), ('k', 11) ])
print(dd)

# note that "order of insertion" is exactly that; if you want sorted, do:
print(sorted(dd.items()))
# (whereas sorted(dd) only returns the sorted dictionary keys)

# because of the order, we can have pop() and popitem() for instance:
dd.popitem()


# The new implementation stores in the hash tables indices to the elements
# stored in a separate entries table - as illustrated below.
#
# Old design:                 New design:
#   --- Hash table ----         - Hash table -   -- Entries table --
#   | key 2 | value 2 |         |      2     |   | key 0 | value 0 |
#   -------------------         --------------   -------------------
#   |       |         |         |            |   | key 1 | value 1 |
#   -------------------         --------------   -------------------
#   | key 0 | value 0 |         |      0     |   | key 2 | value 2 |
#   -------------------         --------------   -------------------
#   | key 1 | value 1 |         |      1     |   |       |         |
#   -------------------         --------------   -------------------


#%% Ordered dictionary, where items are stored in order of insertion
from collections import OrderedDict
od = OrderedDict([ ('z', 26), ('g', 7), ('k', 11) ])
print(od)

# Since the standard Python dictionary now behaves like an OrderedDict, there
# is no real need for the latter anymore... both are nearly the same. (It will
# remain in the collections module so as not to break existing code...)

# OrderedDict has some additional methods such as to reorder elements, e.g.:
od.move_to_end('z')
print(od)
# which can be emulated in a dictionary anyway, as
dd['z'] = dd.pop('z')


# Immutable dictionary: frozendict, available as third-party module  (not
# included in Python because the demand is low, according to the designers)

# Note that the concept of immutable vs. mutable classes and objects was made
# popular by the Java language, and is adopted heavily by Python. (C++ does
# not provide immutable versions of classes.)

##  LISP/SCHEME EMULATION

#%% To get Lisp-style linked lists, one can emulate cons cells using tuples:
lisp_list = ("like",  ("this",  ("example", None) ) )

def car(lst): return lst[0]
def cdr(lst): return lst[1]
def cons(atm,lst): return (atm, lst)

car( cdr( lisp_list))               # lisp: (car (cdr lisp_list))
cons('just', lisp_list)             # lisp: (cons 'just' lisp_list)

# etc. Writing a Lisp interpreter in Python is left as an exercise. %^)

# Some idea to get started:
def lisp_eval(code):
    expr = code[1:-1].split(' ')
    return eval(expr[0] + '(' + expr[1] + ')')

lisp_eval('(car lisp_list)')        # works fine -> 'like'

#lisp_eval('(car (cdr lisp_list))') # needs recursive evaluation...
