# Also, case of a MinMax function that returns both min and max values from a
# sequence, thus requiring 1 traversal only (vs. 1 for min + 1 for max), etc.


#%% Is Python call-by-value or is it call-by-reference (C++ style)?
#   Neither! The best way to describe it is "call-by-object-reference"
# (somewhat a bit like Java itself...) To spell it out with an example:

def plural(noun): return noun+'s'   # noun is a local var/ref. to arg object
pet = 'cat'                         # pet is a ref. to string object ("cat")
plural(pet)                         # noun is pet, they refer to same object

# note: Everything so far has global scope. 'pet' and 'plural' are references
# to string and function objects, resp. - defined at the top level. However,
# 'noun' is defined in the function block hence its scope is limited to it;
# it is a local reference to the same string object as pet (in this case).


# Remember, Python is an interpreted language and everything is evaluated
# dynamically at runtime! The same applies to e.g., function definition:
if pet:
    def dg(n): print(n+2)
else:
    def dg(n): print(n*2)
dg(5)

if pet:
    dg = lambda n: print(n+2)       # equivalent def using lambda expression
else:                               # -> a binding to an anonymous function
    dg = lambda n: print(n*2)       # (see further below)


#%% Nested functions, good for helper functions, also to protect functions
#  from changes, since their scope is only that of the enclosing function.

    return x % 2 == 0

    c = '*'

##  PYTHON CLOSURES
##


#%% A closure is a runtime environment whereby some data from the outer scope
#   is remembered even if it went out of scope or if the function itself was
# removed from the current namespace. The combination of the code and the
# data attached to it (as needed) is called a closure. Example:

def mpr(s):
    def p(): print(s)            # nested function p can access the nonlocal
    p()                          # variable s of the enclosing function
mpr('works fine')

def mprf(s):                     # now returns a nested function p that uses
    def p(): print(s)            # variable s -- after function mprf returned
    return p                     # variable s should go out of scope(?) but

rf = mprf('still works!')        # the created function rf can still access
rf()                             # the data in the former variable s

del mprf ; rf()                  # still works, even though mprf was removed


# Function objects also have a __closure__ attribute that returns a tuple of
# cell objects if it is a closure function (i.e., part of a closure).
# e.g.
rf.__closure__
# Cell objects have an attribute which stores the closure value, e.g.:
rf.__closure__[0].cell_contents  #-> above string, 'still works!'


# When is a closure created in Python? When the following criteria are met:
#   (1) We  have a nested function (a function defined inside a function);
#   (2) The nested function refers to data defined in the enclosing function;
#   (3) The enclosing function returns the nested function.
#
# Note that it makes no difference whether the nested function is defined
# using a def statement or using a lambda expression.

# Why are closures useful? They allow avoiding the use of globals (!) and
# provide some form of data hiding. They can also provide a more elegant
# alternative to implementing a class i.e., when the class has few methods
# (one method, in many cases). When the number of attributes and methods
# is larger, it is usually better to implement a class.

##  LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS
##


#%% Lambda expressions are anonymous functions i.e., function objects that are
#   not bound to any identifier (reference). Î»-expressions come from Lambda
# Calculus, which is the formal logic used in CS to express computation.
#
# Î»-expressions are fully supported in Functional Programming languages, and
# partially (yet increasingly) supported in more popular languages such as
# Python 3, Java 8, C++11, C#, JavaScript, etc.
#
# Syntax differences (in Python) include: no parentheses around arguments,
# implicit return statement, alternate if/else syntax...
# The biggest limitation is that Î»-expressions in non-FP languages are pretty
# much limited to single line body. (In Functional Programming, there is *no*
# difference between a function and a Î»-expression.)

def odd(n): return n % 2 != 0       # using standard function 'def' syntax
type(odd)
odd (5)
oddfun = odd                        # another reference to the same function
oddfun(7)

oddl = lambda n: n % 2 != 0         # same using an anonymous Î»-expression
type(oddl)                          # now bound to an identifier (a name)
oddl(5)

# note: since functions are just objects, it makes sense that we can use
# anonymous functions just like we can use anonymous objects (without ref.)

'anonymous str object' [5]          # string object, without any reference

(lambda n: n % 2 != 0) (5)          # function object, without any reference

if pet:
    dg = lambda n: print(n+2)       # prev. example again, with Î»-expressions
else:
    dg = lambda n: print(n*2)

# See further below for actual usage examples of lambda expressions, either
# as argument to another function, or returned value from a function.


# note: Functions and lambda expressions are examples of subroutines, where
# all code is executed sequentially / synchronously. Coroutines on the other
# hand are subroutines where code is executed concurrently / asynchronously.
# (See section 13. Threads and Concurrency.)

##  FUNCTION OVERLOADING (NOT!)
##

#%% Python has *no* function overloading! Instead it has dynamic reference
#   binding. It follows that every function has a single definition, which
# can be replaced dynamically any time. Default values must used instead to
# provide different versions of a function...

def fol(n): print(n+1)
fol(3)

def fol(n): print(n*5)              # dynamically (re)defines the function
def fol(n,p): print(n*p)            # same, not overloading!

fol(3,4)                            # 12 - as expected
#fol(3)                             # TypeError: missing 1 required arg: 'p'

def fol(n,p=5): print(n*p)
fol(3)                              # 15, since only the second version exists

# The above becomes obvious if using lambda expression syntax: in all cases
# we are just binding the name fol to a function object, e.g.
fol = lambda n: print(n+1)
# etc. Hence each 'def' statement is merely reassigning the reference (name)
# to another Î»-expression or function object -- not overloading!

# note that C++ has both overloading and default values, Java has overloading
# but no default values, and Python has default values but no overloading.



################################
##
##  FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS
##


#%% In Python, functions and lambda expressions are "first-class entities"

#%% Example of a function that returns a function object! This is useful to
#   create new function programmatically, as and when needed.
from math import log

def make_logB(base):
    def logB(x): return log(x) / log(base) # ad hoc function created and
    return logB                            # returned as value

log2(1024)                          # then call it

# note that the base variable of make_logB went out of scope, but the value
# was passed with the logB function inside a closure (cf. details earlier),
# and thus it is available later when calling the logB function.

def logB(base):
    return lambda x: log(x) / log(base) # same with a lambda expr. (simpler)
                                    # allows creating and calling anonymous
logB(2) (1048576)                   # functions (e.g. for one-time use)

# note again that the base value from logB was returned inside a closure along
# with the lambda expression, which is why the code works as expected.

# The above is also simple example where using a closure might be preferable
# to defining a class that is creating function objects...

##  PYTHON DECORATORS
##


#%% This is also useful when defining a decorator i.e, a function that takes
#   another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it!
# Note that decorators in Python make extensive use of closures as well.
def add_stars(func):
    def stars_wrapper(stars='*'*8):
        print(stars)
        func()                      # the value of func is passed inside a
        print(stars)                # closure so that stars_wrapper can use it
    return stars_wrapper

def func1(): print("boring")        # no decorator here
func1()

add_stars(func1)()                  # call the function directly

@add_stars                          # decorator syntax: @ + function name
def func2(): print("Flashy!")       # the decorated function

func2()                             # call the decorated function

func2.__closure__[0].cell_contents  # func2 is a closure function

# The @ syntax is just a shortcut, equivalent to func2 = add_stars(func2)

def func3(): print("decorated?")
func3 = add_stars(func3)
func3()


# note: A decorator is basically a callable that returns a callable i.e., an
# object that implements the special __call__() method (see details earlier).
# A decorator takes a function object as argument, adds some functionality,
# and returns it. Invoking that function calls the decorated version.

##  TYPE ANNOTATIONS [v3.6]
##


#%% Standard version, where no type is specified:
def greeting(name):
    print('Hello', name)
# So the argument passed could be anything:
greeting('Sam')
greeting(1234)

# A better version could rely on some operation to raise an exception if the
# arg type is not supported e.g., string concatenation with a non-string arg
# (note this is better than explicitly using isinstance)
def greeting(name):
    print('Hello ' + name)
greeting('Sam')                     # fine; then a non-string argument will
#greeting(1234)                     # cause a TypeError: must be str, not int
                                    # (-> need to catch the exception)

# Using annotations, the type of function arguments and/or its return values
# can be specified. The syntax is similar to Haskell and other languages [FP]
# i.e., using : type to specify paremeter type and -> for the return type
# e.g.
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
# The argument passed could still be anything; type is NOT checked at runtime!
greeting('Sam')
greeting(1234)

# However, code using type annotations is clearer (shows intent), and it can
# now be checked by a separate (off-line) type checker, such as within an
# editor or IDE (e.g. PyCharm!), or by a compiler, etc.
# Many static type checkers are available e.g., Pyright, Pytype, Pyre, Mypy.


#%% Function type annotations are stored in the __annotations__ attribute:
greeting.__annotations__

# Type annotations are also available for variables [v3.6] e.g.
var = 3
# can now be written as follows
var: int = 3
# Type annotations also allow 'declaring' a variable without initializing it.
surname: str

# This again improves clarity even though NO type checking occurs at runtime.
count: int = 'oops'
surname = 1+2j


#%% Composite types via the typing module (annotations)

# so far we can do
names: list = ['Alan', 'Bart', 'Carl']
# which says names is a reference to a list object; but there is no hint
# about the type of the list elements e.g., names[1]. Same for options.
options: dict = {'title': True, 'center': False}

# So we can use instead the special types defined in the typing module.
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Sequence # also Set, Deque, Counter...

names: List[str] = ['Alan', 'Bart', 'Carl']
options: Dict[str, bool] = {'title': True, 'center': False}

# The special Sequence type can be used whenever we just need a sequence and
# it does not matter whether it is a list or a tuple... Note that a Sequence
# is anything that supports len() and .__getitem__(), independently of its
#  actual type. (This is another example of Python "duck typing".)
def enum(elems: Sequence[str], start: int = 0) -> List[Tuple[int, str]]:
    return list(enumerate(elems,start))

enum(('a','b','c','d'))
enum(('J','Q','K','A'),10)

# It is also possible to create custom type annotations, as aliases, e.g.
Pair = Tuple[int, str]
Strings = Sequence[str]
# then the above function can be simplified to
def enum(elems: Strings, start: int = 0) -> List[Pair]:
    return list(enumerate(elems,start))


# Reasons to use type hints/annotations in your Python code:
#   (1) Easier to understand and maintain a code base;
#   (2) Easier to refactor code e.g. to find where a class is used;
#   (3) Easier to use libraries e.g. smarter suggestions from IDE;
#   (4) Easier to verify code e.g. using type linter tools;
#   (5) Easier to validate data at runtime e.g. function parameters;
#
# However, type hints/annotations cannot provide runtime type inference,
# or even performance tuning (e.g. to optimise the generated bytecode).
#
# In short, type hints are designed to improve the developer's experience,
# not to influence how a Python script evaluates or how fast it runs.
